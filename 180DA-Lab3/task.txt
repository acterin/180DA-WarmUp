6 Task
1. Please submit a screenshot of you playing your command-line game and your PyGame game with
another person.
2. Try reading a bit on one other GUI library. Sometimes you donâ€™t need a full game loop interface to
implement the games that we are working on, so you can try an easier (or more flexible) interface.
3. Describe in a short blurb how you think you want to do graphics for your project.
4. As always, please remember to submit all new code into your public ECE180D-Warmup repository.
