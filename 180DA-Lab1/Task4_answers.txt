1. HSV is typically better for object detection for the color blue because HSV separates color information (Hue) from brightness and intensity (Value). 
The HSV threshold range that I need to track my object was [100, 50, 50] (low) to [130, 255, 255] (high).
The RGB threshold range that I used to track my object was [0, 0, 100] (low) to [100, 100, 255] (high)

2. With lights turned off, there wasn't much difference in object detection.

3.Color Picker and Phone Brightness
Tested in low, middle, and high phone brightness 
HSV: Seems a little bit worse in higher brightness conditions
RGB: The object tracking worked seemingly better than HSV.
Both color schemes worked very well in low/medium brightness, but RGB did a little bit better in high brightness. 

4. My T-shirt seems more robust to brightness. 
The color via the phone less robust to brightness because: 
The phone brightness has a wider range of brightness and changes the color more significantly in RGB. 
The phone also reflects light from other light sources, so there is also more visual noise.
